# Identification of systems based on resonance

I processed a data set from a digital oscilloscope applying non-parametric methods and exploiting the resonance phenomenon to extract relevant information.
I estimated the Bode Diagram by experimental methods, selecting representative points from the signal areas.
The validation of the obtained mathematical models was performed using parametric methods, checking the autocorrelation by the ARMAX method and the intercorrelation by the IV,OE methods.
I obtained an accurate model in accordance with the initial requirements, and small experimental errors.
